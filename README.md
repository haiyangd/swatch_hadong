swatch
======

A clone of http://sourceforge.net/projects/swatch/ version 3.2.3 with my own personal tweaks:

rev 1:
  - Added level 4 to perlcode, which inserts code into the end of the
    threshold conditional.  This allows you to write a configuration that
    keeps a count of the number of times a message is seen. Example can 
    be found in examples/swatchrc.perlcode
